# Cipher Zero Protocol Smart Contracts

## Overview

Welcome to the Cipher Zero Protocol smart contract repository. This collection of contracts forms the backbone of our decentralized, privacy-focused file sharing and messaging platform. Our contracts are designed to work seamlessly with Neon EVM, providing native compatibility with both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems.

## Neon EVM Integration

Cipher Zero Protocol leverages Neon EVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation that runs on the Solana blockchain. This innovative integration allows us to:

- Deploy and execute Ethereum-compatible smart contracts on Solana
- Benefit from Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs
- Maintain compatibility with Ethereum tools and standards

Neon EVM enables our contracts to be truly cross-chain, natively running on Solana while remaining fully compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. This approach combines the best of both worlds: Solana's performance and Ethereum's rich developer ecosystem.

## Contract Structure

Our smart contract suite is organized into several key modules:

- `Analytics`: Real-time monitoring and usage analytics
- `Automation`: Escrow services and oracle integration
- `Encryption`: End-to-end encryption and zero-knowledge proof verification
- `Identity`: Decentralized identity and reputation systems
- `Incentives`: File sharing incentives and staking mechanisms
- `VideoStreaming`: Live streaming and on-demand content delivery
- `Assets`: Asset registry and transfer
- `Bridges`: Cross-chain interoperability via Wormhole
- `CipherZero`: Core protocol functionality including file registry and messaging
- `Infrastructure`: Base contracts, storage, and wallet factory
- `Modules`: Security, transaction management, and upgradability
- `Security`: IP anonymization and audit logging
- `Token`: CipherZeroToken (CZT) implementation and transfers
- `ZKSync`: Layer 2 scaling solution integration

## Key Features
